      The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dà xióng
      māo),[4] also known as panda bear or simply panda, is a bear[5] native to
      south central China.[1] It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive
      black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body.
      The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red
      panda. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a
      folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its
      diet.[6] Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses,
      wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In
      captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves,
      oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.[7][8] The giant
      panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan,
      but also in neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu.[9] As a result of farming,
      deforestation, and other development, the giant panda has been driven out
      of the lowland areas where it once lived. The giant panda is a
      conservation-reliant vulnerable species.[10][11] A 2007 report showed 239
      pandas living in captivity inside China and another 27 outside the
      country.[12] As of December 2014, 49 giant pandas lived in captivity
      outside China, living in 18 zoos in 13 different countries.[13] Wild
      population estimates vary; one estimate shows that there are about 1,590
      individuals living in the wild,[12] while a 2006 study via DNA analysis
      estimated that this figure could be as high as 2,000 to 3,000.[14] Some
      reports also show that the number of giant pandas in the wild is on the
      rise.[15] In March 2015, conservation news site Mongabay stated that the
      wild giant panda population had increased by 268, or 16.8%, to 1,864.[16]
      In 2016, the IUCN reclassified the species from "endangered" to
      "vulnerable".[11] While the dragon has often served as China's national
      symbol, internationally the giant panda has often filled this role. As
      such, it is becoming widely used within China in international contexts,
      for example, appearing since 1982 on gold panda bullion coins and as one
      of the five Fuwa mascots of the Beijing Olympics.
