                        <h3>4 Witnesses to Address Judge’s Behavior</h3>
                        <hr />
                        <article>
                            WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Saturday that
                            the F.B.I. will have “free rein” to investigate
                            allegations of sexual misconduct against Judge Brett
                            M. Kavanaugh, but the emerging contours of the
                            inquiry showed its limited scope. Four witnesses
                            will be questioned in coming days about aspects of
                            the assault accusations against Judge Kavanaugh,
                            according to two people familiar with the matter.
                            <br />
                            Left off the list were former classmates who have
                            contradicted Judge Kavanaugh’s congressional
                            testimony about his drinking and partying as a
                            student. The White House will decide the breadth of
                            the inquiry, though presidential advisers were
                            working in concert with Senate Republicans, said the
                            two people, one a senior administration official,
                            who both spoke on the condition of anonymity to
                            discuss a sensitive. <br />
                            The White House can order investigators to further
                            examine the allegations if their findings from the
                            four witness interviews open new avenues of inquiry,
                            and Mr. Trump seemed to stress that part of the plan
                            in a tweet late on Saturday. “I want them to
                            interview whoever they deem appropriate, at their
                            discretion,” Mr. Trump wrote. He denied an NBC News
                            report that investigators were not permitted to
                            examine the claims of Julie Swetnick, a woman who
                            has said she witnessed a severely drunken Judge
                            Kavanaugh mistreat women at parties in high school.

                            <h4>By KATE ZERNIKE and EMILY STEEL</h4>
                            One of the first stories Gretchen Carlson covered in
                            her career as a television journalist was the 1991
                            Senate hearing where Anita Hill sat alone at the
                            witness table and testified that Clarence Thomas had
                            sexually harassed her. Then, Ms. Carlson said, “I
                            was promptly harassed on the job.” <br />
                            But it wasn’t for another 25 years that she would
                            file her explosive sexual harassment lawsuit against
                            Roger Ailes, the powerful founding chairman of Fox
                            News. Ms. Carlson, too, was largely alone; it was
                            July 2016, more than a year before the #MeToo
                            movement would erupt, and even female colleagues at
                            her own network questioned her actions. While she
                            won a $20 million settlement, Mr. Ailes left the
                            network with a $40 million payout. As she watched
                            this week as another Supreme Court nominee faced
                            sexual assault allegations — this time from a woman
                            supported by sexual assault survivors and female
                            senators sitting behind her — Ms. <br />
                            Carlson could not help seeing the effects of the
                            revolution she helped start, and its limits. “We’ve
                            made such great strides with regard to the fact that
                            women coming forward now are given a platform to
                            tell their story,” she said. “That would have never
                            happened before. But we are still in the ‘he said,
                            she said.’” The next week may not reveal
                            conclusively whether the nominee, Judge Brett M.
                            Kavanaugh, sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford
                            when they were teenagers, as she claims and he
                            denies. The Judiciary Committee on Friday agreed to
                            a one-week supplemental background check into Judge
                            Kavanaugh by the F.B.I. But with all of its emotion
                            and anger — and even the Republicans’ last-minute
                            forced reversal on the background check — the fight
                            over his nomination shows how the dynamics of the
                            #MeToo movement have threaded their way into
                            American life. <br />
                            And depending on what the F.B.I. finds and how the
                            Senate responds, it could serve as the test case for
                            the power of the #MeToo movement.

                            <strong>DENVER — </strong>
                            measure, this city is booming. The unemployment rate
                            is below 3 percent. There is so much construction
                            that a local newspaper started a “crane watch”
                            feature. Seemingly every week carries headlines
                            about companies bringing high-paying jobs to the
                            area. Yet Denver’s once-soaring housing market has
                            run into turbulence. <br />
                            Sales and construction activity have slowed in
                            recent months. Houses that would once have drawn a
                            frenzy of offers elementary-school are sitting on
                            the market for days or weeks. Selling prices are
                            rising more slowly, and asking prices are being
                            slashed to attract buyers. Similar slowdowns have
                            hit New York, Seattle and even San Francisco, cities
                            that until recently ranked among the nation’s
                            hottest housing markets. <br />
                            The specifics vary, but economists, real estate
                            agents and home builders say the core issue is the
                            same: Home buyers are reaching a breaking point
                            after years of breakneck price increases that far
                            exceeded income gains. “The local economy is still
                            fantastic, all the fundamentals are there, but
                            obviously wages are not keeping pace,” said Steve
                            Danyliw, a Denver realtor. “As the market continues
                            to move up, buyers are being pushed out.” Rachel
                            Sandoval is one of them. An elementary-school
                            teacher in the Denver Public Schools.

                    <h3>
                        In South Africa’s Governing Party, Members Are Killing
                        Members
                    </h3>
                    UMZIMKHULU, South Africa — Their fear faded as they raced
                    back home, the bottle of Johnnie Walker getting lighter with
                    each turn of the road. Soon, Sindiso Magaqa was clapping and
                    bouncing behind the wheel of his beloved V8 Mercedes-Benz,
                    pulling into familiar territory just before dark. Minutes
                    later, men closed in with assault rifles. Mr. Magaqa reached
                    for the gun under his seat — too late. <br />
                    One of his passengers saw flashes of light, dozens of them,
                    from the spray of bullets pockmarking the doors. The ambush
                    was exactly what Mr. Magaqa had feared. A few months before,
                    a friend had been killed by gunmen in his front yard. Then,
                    as another friend tried to open his front gate at night, a
                    hit man crept out of the dark, shooting him dead. Next came
                    Mr. Magaqa, 34. Struck half a dozen times, he hung on for
                    weeks in a hospital before dying last year. <br />
                    All of the assassination targets had one thing in common:
                    They were members of the African National Congress who had
                    spoken out against corruption in the party that defined
                    their lives. “If you understand the Cosa Nostra, you don’t
                    only kill the person, but you also send a strong message,”
                    said Thabiso Zulu, another A.N.C. whistle-blower who,
                    fearing for his life, is in hiding. “We broke the rule of
                    omertà,” he added, saying that the party of Nelson Mandela
                    had become like the Mafia. Political assassinations are
                    rising sharply in South Africa, threatening the stability of
                    hardhit parts of the country and imperiling Mr. <br />
                    Mandela’s dream of a unified, democratic nation. But unlike
                    much of the political violence that upended the country in
                    the 1990s, the recent killings are not being driven by
                    vicious battles between rival political parties. Quite the
                    opposite: In most cases, A.N.C. officials are killing one
                    another, hiring professional hit men to eliminate fellow
                    party members in an all-or-nothing fight over money, turf
                    and power, A.N.C. officials say. The party once inspired
                    generations of South Africans and captured the imagination
                    of millions around the world — from impoverished corners of
                    Africa to wealthy American campuses.
